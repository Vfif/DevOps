# Bash

1. Use for loops to display only odd natural numbers from 1 to 99.  
2. Write a Bash script which accepts name as input and displays a greeting: "Welcome (name)"  
3. Use a for loop to display the natural numbers from 1 to 50.  
4. Read in one character from STDIN.
   If the character is 'Y' or 'y' display "YES".
   If the character is 'N' or 'n' display "NO".
   No other character will be provided as input.  
5. Given three integers (x, y, and z) representing the three sides of a triangle, identify whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.  
6. Given two integers, x and y, identify whether x < y or x > y or x = y.
   
   Exactly one of the following lines:
   - X is less than Y
   - X is greater than Y
   - X is equal to Y
7. Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array and then display the entire array, with a space between each of the countries' names.  
8. Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then, concatenate the array with itself (twice) - so that you have a total of three repetitions of the original array - and then display the entire concatenated array, with a space between each of the countries' names.  
9. You are given a list of countries, each on a new line. Your task is to read them into an array and then filter out (remove) all the names containing the letter 'a' or 'A'.
10. Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array and then display the count of elements in that array.
11. Display a range of characters starting at the second position of a string and ending at the 7th position (both positions included).  
12. You are given a text file that will be piped into your command through STDIN. Use grep to display all the lines that contain the word the in them. The search should be sensitive to case. Display only those lines of the input file that contain the word 'the'.
13. You are given a text file that will be piped into your command through STDIN. Use grep to display all the lines that contain the word the in them. The search should NOT be sensitive to case. Display only those lines of the input file that contain the word 'the'.  
14. You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A-Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively. Your task is to identify those lines that do not contain all three scores for students.  
15. You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A-Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively. Your task is to identify whether each of the students has passed or failed. A student is considered to have passed if (s)he has a score 50 or more in each of the three subjects.
